### Made with ❤️ in 🇹🇷

tr-lang is a language that aims to bring programming language syntax closer to Turkish.
tr-lang has half-stack, half-regional based approach to memory management.
tr-lang syntax has become infix from postfix starting with 0.4.0-rc1.

# 🚀 Installation

## 🪟 Windows
<!-- // Broken! Does not work!
### 📇 tr-lang_Setup.exe
For windows there is a setup program.
Just download it and run it.
Follow the instructions and you are ready to go!
-->

### 📇 Pre-Compiled Executable
For windows there is a pre-compiled binary.
Just download it, extract the zip and you are ready to go!
> Note: This binary won't be in the PATH environment variable by default
> meaning it won't be globally usable across the system with 'tr-lang'
>
> If you want to add tr-lang to your PATH environment variable you can follow this [tutorial](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) by Ryan Hoffman
